                <b>Professional Background&#58; </b>
                <p>I have been able to work with my father for numerous years, grave digging. I also worked at Academy Sports in Gastonia for a little over a year, where I learned just how severe shoplifting can be.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Academic Background&#58; </b>
                <p>I finished an Associates in Science at Gaston College before I began studying computer science. I transferred to UNC Charlotte last year and it took me a while to get used to the different environment that a university is versus a community college.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Primary Computer Platform&#58; </b>
                <p>MacOS</p>

                <b>Courses I'm Taking &amp; Why&#58; </b>

                    <li>
                        <b>ITIS3135 &#45; Web-Based Application Design &amp; Development&#58; </b>
                        <p>I am taking this course to help progress through the computer science program and I believe it will be useful to understand the development of websites as well as learning another form of coding for my future in computer science.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>ITIS3200 &#45; Intro to Info Security &amp; Priv&#58; </b>
                        <p>Taking this course will help develop my understanding of cybersecurity and will help prepare me for the Security+ certification.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>ITSC3155 &#45; Software Engineering&#58; </b>
                        <p>I am taking this course in part because it is required but also because it will allow me to understand the development and maintenance of software that I am sure to encounter in my future. It will also allow me to gain experience in working with peers to solve problems and work as a team to develop software.</p>
                    </li>

                <b>Funny/interesting Item to Remember Me By&#58; </b>
                <p>I have fallen into a grave before and crawled back out (It was work related).</p>
